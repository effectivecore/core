Type            : content management system/framework
Author          : Maxim Rysevets
Developer       : Maxim Rysevets
Initial release : 2020-01-01
Written in      : PHP
Operating system: UNIX (Apple macOS, FreeBSD), Linux, Microsoft Windows
License         : proprietary software
Website         : http://effcore.com

effcore is a next-generation CMS (Content Management System)
and CMF (Content Management Framework) developed by between 2017 and 2020.
It incorporates all the new Web 2.0/3.0 technologies including
HTML5, CSS3, JS ES6, IP v6, SVG, SMIL, UTF8, UTC, WAI-ARIA,
NoSQL, Markdown, UML, PSR-0.

Can be used as a tool for building sites by simple users, and also
as a tool for the development of sites, portals and services by
professional web developers.

The name of the system is an acronym and comes from the phrase "effective core".
The system was made from scratch. Its main principle is the complete absence of
third-party code (to exclude legal claims and any other restrictions which
related with borrowing), and third-party ideas (to search for new innovative
solutions).

The impetus for the creation of the system was a massive degradation in the
development of Open Source projects. If consider this situation,
it's can see that the developers of such projects are people with the
different skill levels and which located in different parts of the planet.
Incoordination in their actions and different views on solutions
in the project is only part of the problem.
Second significant flaw - this is an extensive way to develop code in such
projects as opposed to intensive, i.e. instead of creating own code,
they usually take another library which it's written not clear by whom
and it's not clear by where and try to combine it with a group of the
same libraries, not coordinated among themselves and having redundant
and not fully tested functionality.
As a result, we get a set of obscure and inconsistent libraries with poorly
tested redundant functionality which is constantly growing in volume.
Unfortunately, many developers are bogged down in such code and
are trying to deny the obvious.

The main emphasis in the system is on to get maximum performance.
As evaluation criteria, a simple and understandable condition was applied:
a system which installed on a web hosting with the cheapest tariff plan (from
~3-5$ per month), which compliant with the minimum installation requirements,
should generate a homepage in 0.002 seconds (when OPCache is enabled),
or 0.02 seconds (when OPCache is disabled), which in the first case
allows serving up to ~500 clients per second, and in the second
to ~50 (excluding parallel loading of connected files).


Content management
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Content management in the system is focused on the inline insertion
of any available block (menu, text, forms, breadcrumbs and others)
directly to the layout of the edited page. When creating a new page,
the user is given a choice of layout and each new page can have its
own unique blocks arrangement.


File organization
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In each module everything necessary for frontend development
is stored in the "module_*/frontend" directory,
and for backend development - in the "module_*/backend" directory.
All NoSQL data is located in a directory "module_*/data".

In fact, the operation of the files does not depend on their location
and if necessary they will still be found and processed, and their
location in certain directories - it's only an organizational measure
designed to facilitate the work with the system.


Architecture
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The architecture is made according to the classical MVC scheme.
It's a hybrid system of NoSQL and SQL storages and a set of
classes/class-patterns.

The system code is adapted for reuse.
The system consists of many small classes/class-patterns,
containing on average from 3 to 15 methods,
consisting on average of 3-7 lines of code.

Thanks to the "matrix" style of code layout, its perception is
greatly facilitated (reminds Python syntax in some places), and
proper location of files in the system give ability to determine
their purpose without resorting to any documentation.
Also, everything that seems complicated was rejected or remade.
Each function iteratively improved from 3 to 10 times.
Functional testing was performed on the whole set of
combinatorial permutations.

Has a built-in parser and class loader PSR-0, thanks to which, to add
a new library (a set of classes), it's enough to place the files
containing them on a web server and reset the cache, after which they
become available from anywhere in the system.
The system includes a page with a UML diagram of all classes and a link
to download a JSON file with a description of the classes in StarUML
program format.


Security
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Also an important factor in the system is security.
As solutions to increase the level of security were used:
- the ability to work without JS;
- key-signed user sessions;
- key-signed form validation identifiers;
- the use of prepared SQL queries;
- filtering of user input in form fields;
- filtering of URL argument;
- single entry point of any HTTP request,
  as a result - no negative effects when the web server
  is configured incorrectly (".htaccess", "web.config");
- the ability to create a new file type with full access control;
- the ability to get a page assembly hash in the system console;
- CAPTCHA base module.

Determinism in the system work - another important factor.
With the same input parameters, the same result should be reproduced
regardless of platform and as result - complete rejection of
functions which work depends on the environment (for example "setlocale"
and others).


Core: NoSQL
---------------------------------------------------------------------

All data is stored as PHP code.
Perhaps the fastest storage after "storage in RAM".
After organizing the disk in RAM, it's possible to increase performance
by 3-5 times (more details in the section "Performance improvement").
Each storage subdirectory will be initialized only on demand.

Any instance of the class and other NoSQL data can be described
in text format in a file of type "*.data", like YAML, but has a more
stringent rules such as "each string can contain the only one
phrase in the form "key: value".

It's comfortable for controlling changes in the code - any change
of one key or value will be highlighted in "git diff" with just one line.
Also, this format significantly speeds up parsing the files.

Below is given an example of "*.data" file.

    demo
      object_1|class_name
        property_1: value 1
        property_2: value 2 …
        property_N: value N
      array_1
      - item_1: value 1
      - item_2: value 2 …
      - item_N: value N

At the same time, both objects (instances of class-patterns) and arrays
can have any nesting levels and contain inside any other objects or
arrays.

After parsing "*.data" files, the result is converted to PHP code (single
tree of objects - instances of class-patterns), after which it's
saved to files "dynamic/cache/cache-*.php" separately for each kind of
entity, as shown in the example below:
- dynamic/cache/data--blocks.php
- dynamic/cache/data--breadcrumbs.php
- dynamic/cache/data--file_types.php
and so on.

The example described above will be converted to a PHP
file of the following form:

    namespace effcore {
      cache::$data['demo'] = new \stdClass;
      cache::$data['demo']->object_1 = new class_name;
      cache::$data['demo']->object_1->property_1 = 'value 1';
      cache::$data['demo']->object_1->property_2 = 'value 2';
      cache::$data['demo']->object_1->property_N = 'value N';
      cache::$data['demo']->array_1['item_1'] = 'value 1';
      cache::$data['demo']->array_1['item_2'] = 'value 2';
      cache::$data['demo']->array_1['item_N'] = 'value N';
    }

This architecture give ability to access NoSQL data as quickly as possible.
When using the PHP module OPCache, the access speed can increase
from 2 to 3 times. In fact, to access NoSQL data, it's enough to
load a PHP file of a certain entity and data will be available
immediately after loading.

Thus, the core of the system is the aforementioned set of class-patterns
and NoSQL storage, which cache is represented as PHP code, containing
instances of these classes in tree form with any level of nesting
and unlimited by structure.

Changing the structure of NoSQL data is possible only through a special mechanism.
For example, the main menu is located in NoSQL storage and nobody cannot
disrupt its work. The anonymous user menu is stored in SQL storage and
the administrator can edit this menu through the system interface.

Field types are supported:
- integer;
- float;
- boolean;
- string;
- array;
- object|class_name;
- null.


Core: SQL
---------------------------------------------------------------------

MySQL and SQLite can be used as SQL storages.
The required versions can be found in the "readme/software.md" file.
Storage connection and data retrieval will initialize only on demand.
Denying access to SQL storage will not raise an error, but will only
make inaccessible part of the possibilities (for example, sessions
and login will be disconnected, and on the pages with election
"0 results" will be displayed).

The following are supported:
- checks;
- prepared queries (no chance for SQL-injections);
- transactions (begin, roll_back, commit);
- collations (nocase, binary);
- constraints (primary, unique, foreign with cascade action);
- index and unique index;
- connections to remote storages via manual initialization process;
- table prefixes.

Support for cascading foreign key actions:
- on update: "cascade" (not tested feature: "restrict", "no action");
- on delete: "cascade" (not tested feature: "restrict", "no action").

Cross-platform field types are supported:
- autoincrement;
- varchar;
- integer;
- real;
- time;
- date;
- datetime;
- boolean (as integer: 0|1);
- blob.

Other types allowed but not tested.
List of the tested types is sufficient for most tasks.
Only tested types are recommended for cross-platform compatibility reasons.
Distributed queries to remote storages not supported.

The main focus is on ANSI SQL.
PostgreSQL was excluded during development as Web RDBMS with
least compatible of ANSI standards.

It was decided not to use field of type timestamp.
Instead, it's recommended to use field of type datetime.
This field has a wide range of acceptable values (from "0000-01-01"
to "9999-12-31"), and also does not depend on the time zone.
When adding data to the server, dates should be converted to time zone UTC±0:00.
Instead of the original timestamp type, it's recommended
to use the integer type.

CSS, JS, SASS, LESS
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A single entry point allows the system to control the process of issuing
the contents of any file, making it possible to use external variables
in CSS and JS files. Such variables begin with "%%_", and the files
containing them have extensions "cssd" and "jsd".

The project does not implement and considers the CSS and JS streaming
compression technology obsolete due to the following reasons:
- 1 to 10 KiB text files are compressed, that with modern data
  transfer rate is not significant, at the same time, compression
  takes web server resources, and for unpacking - the client (which
  ultimately affects the battery charge of mobile clients).
- for CSS, a file size above 10 KiB is considered to be the result
  of improper cascading of styles and/or usage of disastrous
  technology such as SASS or LESS, which condoning "badcoding".
- JS files can be initially compressed and obfuscated by
  reducing-reorganization of JS code by third-party
  programs or services.
However, no one bothers to use the streaming compression capabilities
of the web server directly.


Event model
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The event model is built fairly transparent and predictable.
It's enough to register a new event in the "events.data" of own module,
specify its weight and handler in PHP code, flush the cache and
the event will begin to be processed. On the "NoSQL Data → Events" page,
can view all events registered in the system (this section will be
available after enable the module "Develop").


Web server
---------------------------------------------------------------------

As a web server, Apache, NGINX, IIS are supported.
The required versions can be found in the "readme/software.md" file.


Caching
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to its architecture, mid-level projects do not require caching.
For large projects, caching is usually done by third-party web server tools,
what is originally supposed by the author.


Decoration
---------------------------------------------------------------------

For decoration of the site/portal in the system exists the section "Decoration".
In this section, the administrator can change the color scheme of the page elements.
The number of colors is limited by the full set of named CSS colors (for example, "black",
"white" and so on). Also in this section there are a color presets and in one click the
administrator can change the design of all available elements (for example,
activate the light design theme). There is also a list of the layouts which
available in the system.

The system operates with only one type of file collection - these are modules.
There are no a themes which familiar to many people.

However, nothing prevents to create a theme in the form of a module,
which may contain, for example, the following functionality:
- colors;
- color presets;
- static cascading style files "*.css";
- static JavaScript files "*.js";
- dynamic cascading style files "*.cssd";
- dynamic JavaScript files "*.jsd";
- templates;
- layouts;
- images;
- favicons.

Do not be afraid of the process of creating a new module.
According the template "Empty module" (see the section "Deployment")
and simple text files of type "*.data" the new functionality (for example
like described above) can be introduced without programming.
It's enough to create files of type "*.data", place them in a new module,
upload this module to the server and flush the cache.
After these actions the new elements will be available
from the administrative interface.


Deployment
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Making changes in system files is a bad idea, because all of them
will be lost after updating the system.

A good solution is to create own module in the "modules" directory.
In the bundle "Examples" there is a module "Empty module", which can be used
as a basis for creating such a module.

In the own module, it will be possible to apply the "Changes" mechanism.
This mechanism give ability to make changes in the system.
Its example is shown in the file "demo--data--changes.data" of the module "Demo".
The "Changes" mechanism modifies the global NoSQL tree, which, after clearing
the cache, will be converted by the system into PHP code.

After creating own module with the necessary settings the deployment process
will look extremely simple - just install the system and enable own module.


Localization
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The system already has translations of its interface into
Belarusian and Russian languages.
It's assumed that for each language version of the site/portal,
the administrator organizes his own subdomain.
In many cases, different language versions of a site/portal differ
not only in content, but also in a structure. For example, the main menu in one
language version may have one set of menu items, and on another - completely different,
in this case, the names of the menu items and their addresses and count will differ.
That is why it was decided not to complicate the system and not to introduce
in many aspects useless functionality.

If any page has a language different from the whole site, then this language
can be specified when creating/editing such a page.
In this case, the administrator must control the language of the content
that appears on this page.

The system uses the more perfect "Plural" system.
Using regular expressions, it's possible to describe almost any
dependence of a part of a word on the numeric and non-numeric arguments
which present in the phrase.


Performance improvement
---------------------------------------------------------------------

It's recommended to enable the PHP OPCache.
It's recommended to use the SSD (Solid State Drives).
In many cases, the "dynamic/cache" directory can be organized in RAM.
To increase the reliability level of the server, such RAM should
support ECC (error-correcting code), and the server itself should
work together with an UPS (uninterruptible power supply).


Licensing
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The system is open and free.
The system is not in the public domain.
Anyone can create a website, portal or service on the basis of it,
both personally and for any customer.
However, not allowed to distribute system files in their original or
modified form or in conjunction with anything else.
This restriction does not apply to third-party modules
whose authors themselves determine the licensing policy.
